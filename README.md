 My journey began with a passion for learning Android development. Using Java and Android Studio, I started
 by familiarizing myself with the basics through tutorials and documentation. I planned a simple, user-friendly interface for my
 Tic-Tac-Toe game. Development involved setting up the project, designing the layout, and implementing the game logic.
 Handling player turns and checking win conditions were key challenges. Debugging and testing on various devices ensured
 smooth performance. Completing the app and playing a full game on my phone was immensely rewarding. This project
 significantly enhanced my coding skills and deepened my understanding of Android development.
